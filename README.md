# Chat-with-X

**Chat-with-X** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant that helps developers solve programming problems related to specific stacks, libraries, or frameworks.

Just ask a question — it intelligently retrieves relevant content from official docs, API references, and source code, then generates a clear, contextual response.

## Features

- 🔍 RAG-powered: retrieves from docs, APIs, and repos  
- 💬 Natural, chat-based Q&A  
- 📦 Flexible support across multiple tech stacks (`X` = React, PyTorch, FastAPI, etc.)
